# gig

Gig is an attempt at implementing a git-compatible command in pure Go (using [go-git](https://github.com/src-d/go-git)).

## Why?

This is intended for Plan 9, where git doesnâ€™t work natively.
Gig requires these two PRs on Plan 9:
* https://github.com/src-d/go-billy/pull/78
* https://github.com/src-d/go-git/pull/1269
